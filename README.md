# Perlox - Lox language implementation written in the Perl language

This is a tree-walking interpreter implementation for the **Lox** language written in Perl.

> This implementation doesn't strictly follow the path which the book "Crafting Interpreters" takes, but is greatly inspired by that.

Currently it's highly **WIP**, but some parts look like a working ones :)
